The Computational Human-Robot Interaction (CHRI) research group at UNSW is headed by [Wafa Johal](wafa.johal.org/) and studies the computational and social aspects of interactions between humans and robots. Our mission is to understand and investigate how humans and robots can learn together (robots learning from humans and humans learning from robots).

Research interests include: human-computer/robot interaction; AI and machine learning for human-robot interaction (HRI); robots for learning; robot assistants for cognitive tasks; robot social  reasoning; nonverbal communication in HRI; and behavioural signal processing for interaction design.
