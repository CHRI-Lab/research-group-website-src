# Call for Participants

We are currently conducting a research project on whether we can determine handwriting legibility solely from a person's handwriting without the need for specialised tests. Right now, we are in the process of collecting digital handwriting using a tablet-based web application.

So if you have a tablet with a digital stylus and would like to contribute your handwriting to this project, please click on the following link -> https://digital-pen-746a6.web.app/

The task will take less than 5 minutes and all responses are totally anonymous.

Thanks in advance for your support!!!
