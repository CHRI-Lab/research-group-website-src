# The Therapist

## Project overview
Serious games have been applied in many fields, and mental health is no exception.
Studies suggest that there are benefits for psychological and behavioural changes
(Fleming et al., 2017), with some serious games even outperforming traditional
methods of treatment. Not only that, but they have also helped to encourage players
to apply the therapeutic methods that they have learnt (Eichenberg and Schott,
2017).
Developing and refining these game-based approaches is important due to their
wider reach of audiences - A study of Australian households in 2015 revealed that
68% of Australians play interactive games. Of these, 78% were 18 or older and 47%
were female (Parliament of Australia Environment and Communications Committee,
2016). Clearly, the appeal of video games are indiscriminate of age, gender or
background. For those who are unwilling or unable to access the mental health
services they require, serious games can help bridge the gap as a more
approachable medium.
However, these games are still in their early years (Fleming et al., 2017) and more
studies need to be carried out before we can draw any definitive conclusions about
their effectiveness (Lau, Smit, Fleming and Riper, 2017). Nevertheless, with the
rapid improvement of technology, along with our growing understanding of how to
best impact our players through game design techniques, these preliminary results
show great promise.

This project proposes to build a serious game, that unlike other does not intend to present itself as an alternate
form of treatment but simply a mode of teaching. Hence our goal is to educate the
users about mental health, and strategies to cope with stress and anxiety.
