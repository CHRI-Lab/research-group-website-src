## Context
 
Social robots are foreseen to be encountered in our everyday life, playing roles as assistant or companion (to mention a few).
Recent studies have shown the potential harmful impacts of overtrust in social robotics [1], as robots may collect sensitive information without the user’s knowledge.

Behavioural styles  allow  robots to express themselves differently within the same context. Given a specific gesture, keyframe manipulation can be used in order to generate style-based variation to the gesture.
Behavioural styles have been studied in the past to improve robot's behaviour during human-robot interaction [2].
 
In this project, we will explore how behavioural styles can influence engagement, trust and persuasion during human-robot interaction.
 
 
 
## Goals & Milestones
 
- Implement behavioural styles for the Nao robot (voice and behaviour) and for a voice assistant (voice only)
- Design at least two behaviour styles based on human behaviour and personality styles
- Evaluate and compare these styles via experimentation 
- Design a scenario similar to the one described in paper [3] 
- Setup a data collection environment (posture, video and audio) in the HRI Lab facility of UNSW
- Select appropriate tasks and/or questionnaires to measure engagement, trust and/or persuasion
- Evaluate the system via an experiment with users
- Complete the data analysis
