## Context

Handwriting is one of the most important motor skill we learn as human. Children with handwriting difficulties can find their academic impacted and often succeed less at school. It is even more true for people having to learn different handwriting scripts (i.e. latin, chinese, arabic)

In this project we propose to explore new methods to assess and train people's handwriting in a multiscript handwriting application. The project will aim to develop a new engaging handwriting analysis tool and integrate the analysis in agamified application.
The backend of the application will be performing the analsysi of handwirting through a library taking into account various features of the handwriting logs (i.e. pen pressure, tilt, speed).


## Goals & Milestones

During this project, the student will:
- Develop a library able to analyse strokes and handwriting (backend)
- Develop a JS app able to record handwriting data
- Integrate gamification into the app to build a learning game
- Evaluate the implemented application with end-users evaluating both usability and performances (learning outcomes)
