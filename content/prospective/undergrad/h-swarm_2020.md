## Context:

Visuo-Motor coordination problems can impair children in  their academic achievements and in their everyday life. 
 Gross visuo-motor skills, in particular, are required in a range of social and educational activities that contribute to children's physical and cognitive development such as playing a musical instrument, ball-based sports or dancing. 
 Children with visuo-motor coordination difficulties are typically diagnosed with developmental coordination disorder  or cerebral palsy and need undergo physical therapy. 
 The therapy sessions are often not engaging for children and conducted individually. 
In this project, we aim to design new forms of interaction with a swarm for enhance visuo-motor coordination. We propose to develop a game that allows multiple children to play collaboratively on the same table. 



## Goals & Milestones
- Implement the set of basic swarm behaviour using 4 Cellulo robots
- Integrate collaorative and tangible interactions
- Test the system with a participants. We plan ti integrate a measure of cognitive load using eye tracking data
