## Context:

Online learning  presents several advantages: decreasing cost, allowing more flexibility and access to far away training resources. However, studies have found that it also limits communications between peers and teachers, limits physical interactions and that it requires a big commitment on the student's part to plan and stay assiduous in their learning.



## Goals & Milestones

In this project, we aim to design and test a novel way to engage students in collaborative online learning by using haptic enabled tangible robots.
The project will consist in:
- developing a tool allowing the design of online activities for two or more robots to be connected
- implementing a demonstrator for this new library that will embed a series of small exercises hilightling the new capability of remote haptic-assisted collaboration
- evaluating the demonstrator with a user experiment



## Topics

HCI, Haptics, Robot, Collaborative Work (Training/Gaminig)

## Prerequisites

- Skills: C++, Js,
