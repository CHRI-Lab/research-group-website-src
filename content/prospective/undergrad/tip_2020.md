## Context

While digital tools are more and more used in classrooms, teachers' common practice remains to use photocopied paper documents to share and collect learning exercises from their students.
With the Tangible e-Ink Paper (TIP) system, we aim to explore the use of tangible manipulatives interacting with paper sheets as a bridge between digital and paper traces of learning.
Featuring an e-Ink display, a paper-based localisation system and a wireless connection, TIPs are envisioned to be used as a versatile tool across various curriculum activities.

## Goals & Milestones

- Literature Review on Tangible UI (TUI) in Education
- Implement and test a proof of concept of TIPs for learning
- Assemble 3 TIPs (3D printing of parts, soldering, etc.)
- Install libraries on Rasberry PI ( e.g. libdots - used for self-paper-based localisation, bluetooth communication) 
- Develop two demo applications using TIPs for 
  - individual work (on A4 sheet of paper)
  - collaborative work (on min A2)

## Topics

Tangible User Interfaces, HCI

## Prerequisites and Learning Outcomes

- Skills: Javascript, Python or C++. Git.
- Qt, Rasberry Pi
