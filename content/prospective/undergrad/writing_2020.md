## Context

Handwriting is one of the most important motor skill we learn as human. Children with handwriting difficulties can find their academic impacted and often succeed less at school. 

In this project we propose to explore new methods for a robot to write using a pen. The project will use the Fetch Robot and aim to evaluate how a robot could learn handwriting trajectories using human demonstrations.

## Goals & Milestones

During this project, the student will:
- Learn about ROS
- Develop a ROS package that enables to control the Fetch Robot arm given a series of handwriting strokes
- Explore the use of different methods for the robot to learn letter writing from demonstrations
- Evaluate the implemented method compare to other state of the art methods

## Topics

ROS, Learning by Demonstration, Robotics, Handwriting

## Prerequisites

- Skills: Python, C++,  ROS, Git.
