abstract: The evolving field of human-robot interaction (HRI) necessitates that we
  better understand how social robots operate and interact with humans. This scoping
  review provides an overview of about 300 research works focusing on the use of the
  NAO robot from 2010 to 2020. This study presents one of the most extensive and inclusive
  pieces of evidence on the deployment of the humanoid NAO robot and its global reach.
  Unlike most reviews, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results regarding
  how NAO is being used and what has been achieved so far. We analyzed a wide range
  of theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions that provide multidimensional
  insights, such as general trends in terms of application, the robot capabilities,
  its input and output modalities of communication, and the human-robot interaction
  experiments that featured NAO (e.g. number and roles of participants, design, and
  the length of interaction). Lastly, we derive from the review some research gaps
  in current state-of-the-art and provide suggestions for the design of the next generation
  of social robots.
