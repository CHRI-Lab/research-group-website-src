abstract: This interdisciplinary project aims to assess and manage the risks relating
  to the transition of Kazakh language from Cyrillic to Latin in Kazakhstan in order
  to address challenges of a) teaching and motivating children to learn a new script
  and its associated handwriting, and b) training and providing support for all demographic
  groups, in particular senior generation. We present the system demonstration that
  proposes to assist and motivate children to learn a new script with the help of
  a humanoid robot and a tablet with stylus.
