abstract: Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) have been found to be relevant tools for
  collaborative learning by providing a shared workspace and enhancing joint visual
  attention. Researchers have explored the use of TUIs in a variety of curricular
  activities and found them particularly interesting for spatial exploration. However,
  very few studies have explored how TUIs could be used as a collaborative medium
  for people with visual impairments (VIs). In this study, we investigated the effect
  of tangible interaction (a small tangible robot) in a spatial collaborative task
  (a treasure hunt) involving two people with VIs. The aim was to evaluate the impact
  of the design of the TUI on the collaboration and the strategies used to perform
  the task. The experiment involved six dyads of people with VIs. The results showed
  that the collaboration was impacted by the interaction design and open interesting
  perspectives on the design of collaborative games for people with VIs.
