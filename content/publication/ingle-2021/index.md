abstract: "Previous research in psychology has found that human faces have the capability
  of being more distracting under high perceptual load conditions compared to non-face
  objects.  This project aims to assess the distracting potential of robot faces based
  on their human-likeliness. As a first step, this paper reports on our initial findings
  based on an online study. We used a letter search task where participants had to
  search for a target letter within a circle of 6 letters, whilst an irrelevant distractor
  image was also present.  The results of our experiment replicated previous results
  with human faces and non-face objects. Additionally, in the tasks where the irrelevant
  distractors are images of robot faces, the human-likeness of the robot influenced
  the response time (RT).  Interestingly, the robot Alter produced results significantly
  different than all other distractor robots.  The outcome of this is a distraction
  model related to human-likeness of robots. Our results show the impact of anthropomorphism
  on distracting potential and thus should be taken into account when designing robots."
