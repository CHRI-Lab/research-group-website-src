abstract: "In  this  paper,  we  present  an  experiment  in  the context of a child-robot interaction where we study the influence of  the  child-robot  spatial  arrangement  on  the  child’s  focus  of attention and the perception of the robot’s performance. In the “Co-Writer learning by teaching” activity, the child teaches a Nao robot how to handwrite. Usually only face-to-face spatial arrangements are tested in educational child robot interactions, but  we  explored  two  spatial  conditions  from  Kendon’s  F-formation,  the  side-by-side  and  the  face-to-face  formations  in a  within  subject  experiment.  We  estimated  the  gaze  behavior of  the  child  and  their  consistency  in  grading  the  robot  with regard  to  the  robot’s  progress  in  writing.  Even-though  the demonstrations provided by children were not different between the two conditions (i.e. the robot’s learning didn’t differ), the results showed that in the side-by-side condition children tended to  be  more  indulgent  with  the  robot’s  mistakes  and  to  give it  better  feedback.  These  results  highlight  the  influence  of experimental choices in child-robot interaction"
