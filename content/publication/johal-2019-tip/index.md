abstract: "While digital tools are more and more used in classrooms, teachersâ€™ common practice remain to
use photocopied documents to share and collect learning exercises from their students. With TIP
(Tangible e-Ink Paper) we aim to explore the use of tangible manipulatives to interact with paper
sheets and bridge between digital and paper traces of learning tasks. Featuring an e-Ink display, a
paper-based localisation system and a wireless connection, TIPs is envisioned to be used as a versatile
tool across various curriculum activities. In this paper, we present the design principle of TIPs and a
first functional prototype. We conclude by future work in evaluating TIPs as a distributed sensor for
teacher in their classroom, including learning scenario examples to illustrate our statements.
