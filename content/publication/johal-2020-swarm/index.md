abstract: This study reviews published scientific literature on the use of swarm robots
  for education purposes in the last ten years. It focuses on user studies involving
  robotics swarm in order to identify the potential contributions of the incorporation
  of swarm robots as an educational tool and insight future research. We consider
  here the appearance of swarm robots, the curriculum of the experimental task and
  the interaction modalities between learners and robots. The outcomes of the literature
  review are discussed in terms of their existing challenges and opportunities for
  guiding researchers, educators, and practitioners.
