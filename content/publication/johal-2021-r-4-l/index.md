abstract: The Robots for Learning workshop series aims at advancing the research topics
  related to the use of social robots in educational contexts. This year's half-day
  workshop follows on previous events in Human-Robot Interaction conferences focusing
  on efforts to dis-cuss potential benchmarks in design, methodology and evaluation
  of new robotics systems that help learners. In this 6th edition of the workshop,
  we will be investigating in particular methods from technologies for education and
  online learning. Since the past few months, online and remote learning has been
  put in place in several countries to cope with the health and safety measures due
  to theCovid-19 pandemic. In this workshop, we aim to discuss strategies to design
  robotics system able to provide embodied assistance to the remote learners and to
  demonstrate long-term learning effects.
