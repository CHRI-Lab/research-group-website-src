abstract: "In the Republic of Kazakhstan, the transition from Cyrillic towards Latin alphabet raises challenges to teach the whole population in writing the new script. This paper presents a CoWriting Kazakh system that aims to implement an autonomous behavior of a social robot that would assist children in learning a new script. Considering the fact that the current generation of primary school children have to be fluent in both Kazakh scripts, this exploratory study aims to investigate which learning approach provides better effect. Participants were asked to teach a humanoid robot NAO how to write Kazakh words using one of the scripts, Latin vs Cyrillic. We hypothesize that it is more effective when a child mentally converts the word to Latin in comparison to having the robot perform conversion itself. The findings reject this hypothesis, but further research is needed as it is suggested that the way the pre-test was performed might have caused the obtained results."
