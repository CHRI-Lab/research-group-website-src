abstract: "A key feature of a successful game is its ability to provide the player with an adequate level of challenge. However, the objective of difficulty adaptation in serious games is not only to maintain the player’s motivation by challenging, but also to ensure the completion of training objectives. This paper describes our proposed upper-limb rehabilitation game with tangible robots and investigates the effect of game elements and gameplay on the amount of the performed motion in several planes and percentage of failure by using the data from 33 unimpaired subjects who played 53 games within two consecutive days. In order to provide a more generic adaptation strategy in the future, we discretize the game area to circular zones. We then show the effect of changing these zones during gameplay on the activation of different muscles through EMG data in a pilot study. The study shows that it is possible to increase the challenge level by adding more active agents chasing the player and increasing the speed of these agents. However, only the increase in number of agents significantly increases the users’ motion on both planes. Analysis of player behaviors leads us to suggest that by adapting the behaviour of these active agents in specific zones, it is possible to change the trajectory of the user, and to provide a focus on the activation of specific muscles."
