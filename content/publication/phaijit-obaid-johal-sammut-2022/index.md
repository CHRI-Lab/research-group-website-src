abstract: 'Augmented reality (AR) technologies are today more
frequently being introduced to Human-Robot Interaction to
mediate the interaction between human and robot. Indeed, better
technical support and improved framework integration allow
the design and study of novel scenarios augmenting interaction
with AR. While some literature reviews have been published,
so far no classifications have been devised for the role of AR
in HRI. AR constitutes a vast field of research in HCI, and as
it is picking up in HRI, it is timely to articulate the current
knowledge and information about the functionalities of AR in
HRI. Here we propose a multidimensional taxonomy for AR in
HRI that distinguishes the type of perception augmentation, the
functional role of AR, and the augmentation artifact type. We
place sample publications within the taxonomy to demonstrate
its utility. Lastly, we derive from the taxonomy some research
gaps in current AR-for-HRI research and provide suggestions for
exploration beyond the current state-of-the-art.'
