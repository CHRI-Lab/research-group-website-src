abstract: "This research occurred in a special context where Kazakhstan's recent decision\
  \ to switch from Cyrillic to the Latin-based alphabet has resulted in challenges\
  \ connected to teaching literacy, addressing a rare combination of research hypotheses\
  \ and technical objectives about language learning. Teachers are not necessarily\
  \ trained to teach the new alphabet, and this could result in a challenge for children\
  \ with learning difficulties. Prior research studies in Human-Robot Interaction\
  \ (HRI) have proposed the use of a robot to teach handwriting to children (Hood\
  \ et al., <xref ref-type=\\\"bibr\\\" rid=\\\"B28\\\">2015</xref>; Lemaignan et\
  \ al., <xref ref-type=\\\"bibr\\\" rid=\\\"B44\\\">2016</xref>). Drawing on the\
  \ Kazakhstani case, our study takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together\
  \ smart solutions from robotics, computer vision areas, and educational frameworks,\
  \ language, and cognitive studies that will benefit diverse groups of stakeholders.\
  \ In this study, a human-robot interaction application is designed to help primary\
  \ school children learn both a newly-adopted script and also its handwriting system.\
  \ The setup involved an experiment with 62 children between the ages of 7–9 years\
  \ old, across three conditions: a robot and a tablet, a tablet only, and a teacher.\
  \ Based on the paradigm—learning by teaching—the study showed that children improved\
  \ their knowledge of the Latin script by interacting with a robot. Findings reported\
  \ that children gained similar knowledge of a new script in all three conditions\
  \ without gender effect. In addition, children's likeability ratings and positive\
  \ mood change scores demonstrate significant benefits favoring the robot over a\
  \ traditional teacher and tablet only approaches."
